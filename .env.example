# This file shows what environment variables you need.
# Environment variables are used to store sensitive data like API keys.

# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to ".env" (without .example)
# 2. Replace "your_api_key_here" with your actual Anthropic API key
# 3. NEVER commit the .env file to GitHub (it should be in .gitignore)

# Get your API key from: https://console.anthropic.com/
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
